# Background-and-Foreground-Detection-in-Images-Using-MATLAB-
This code performs foreground-background separation and detects boundaries in an image using binary image processing techniques.

This code performs foreground-background separation by comparing an original frame with a background image.
It applies color and grayscale conversions, converts the resulting image to binary, and applies noise removal through a median filter. 
It identifies and removes noisy regions based on their area, and traces and plots the boundaries of the foreground objects. 
The code provides a visual representation of the detected foreground and background regions.
